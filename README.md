# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains various implementations of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA). The goal of this project is to provide simple and efficient solutions to common problems in computer science. Each folder and file will demonstrate a different data structure or algorithm, along with explanations and example use cases.

## Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each solution is written in **[Programming Language(s)]** and includes detailed explanations on how to use the implemented structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures
Here are the primary data structures included in this repository:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)**
- **Graphs**

Each data structure will be implemented with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Algorithms
This section covers the implementation of various algorithms, including but not limited to:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.

## How to Run
To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA.git
