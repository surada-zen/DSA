# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains various implementations of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA). The goal of this project is to provide simple and efficient solutions to common problems in computer science. Each folder and file will demonstrate a different data structure or algorithm, along with explanations and example use cases.


## Data Structures
Here are the primary data structures included in this repository:
- **Hash maps**

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)**
- **Graphs**


## Algorithms
This section covers the implementation of various algorithms, including but not limited to:
- **Two Pointer**
- **Sliding Window(static window & variable window)**

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.
